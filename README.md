# 10 Different Ciphers
Cipher Algorithms in C++

# Description
This project is a collection of 10 different cipher algorithms implemented in C++. Users can choose from a variety of ciphers to encrypt and decrypt their messages. The ciphers included in this project are:

1. Railfence Cipher
2. XOR Cipher
3. Morse Code Cipher
4. Polybius Square Cipher
And more (additional ciphers can be found in the code)
Each cipher has its unique encryption and decryption mechanism, allowing users to experiment with different methods of securing their data.
